First repository and first ruby program

This is my frist ruby program which will attempt to create the dice game Farkle. The initial version will be single player but I may include a multi-player mode for practice later on. 

-To start game, run file "farkle_start.rb"

Any comments or constructive critisism would be greatly appreciated!
